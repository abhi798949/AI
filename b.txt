 Agentic AI: Empowering Intelligent Autonomy
Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can operate as autonomous agentsâ€”capable of perceiving their environment, setting goals, planning, making decisions, and executing actions without continuous human intervention.

Unlike traditional AI models that simply respond to inputs or queries, Agentic AI systems demonstrate initiative, persistence, and adaptability. They are designed to:

Take ownership of tasks and goals.

Coordinate with other agents or tools.

Adapt to new challenges or changing environments.

Reflect on their actions and improve over time.

Agentic AI plays a key role in the next generation of AI applications, such as:

Automated research assistants.

Autonomous coding agents like Devin.

AI project managers that handle multi-step workflows.

Intelligent customer support agents.

Modern frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, and AutoGen help developers build such systems by combining LLMs (like GPT) with planning, memory, tools, and agent communication.
