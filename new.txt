Agentic AI
– the new
frontier in
GenAI
An executive playbook
Harnessing AI isn’t just about
technology— it’s about unleashing
unprecedented potential.
In an era where speed, efficiency, and customer centricity dictate market leadership, organisations need to
harness every tool at their disposal. Over the past couple of years, artificial intelligence (AI) has exploded onto
the world stage, with companies and individuals across the globe rapidly adopting the technology. The GCC is
playing a lead role in the space, with business leaders in the region exploring ways of integrating this rapidly
developing technology into their operations.
Generative AI (GenAI) is being recognised as a game-changer for innovation in the region, empowering
enterprises by automating routine tasks, enhancing customer experiences and assisting in critical
decision-making processes. Insights from our 27th Annual CEO Survey: Middle East findings have shown that
73% of CEOs in the Middle East believe GenAI will significantly change the way their company creates, delivers
and captures value over the next three years1
. GenAI is poised to make a significant economic impact, with
estimates indicating that it could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to global GDP across
various industries by 2030. In specific sectors, such as energy, investments in GenAI are expected to triple,
from $40 billion in 2023 to over $140 billion by the end of the decade. This surge in investment reflects the
transformative potential of GenAI, particularly in enhancing productivity, streamlining business processes, and
reshaping value chains across industries2
.
Against this backdrop, multimodal GenAI agentic frameworks has emerged as transformative catalysts,
enabling businesses to accelerate process automation at an unprecedented scale. This technology involves
multiple AI agents working together, each specialising in different tasks or data types, to solve complex
problems and automate processes. By collaborating and constantly learning, these agents enhance
decision-making, optimise processes, and drive innovation. It combines range of advanced AI techniques to
process diverse data types and automate complex tasks.
The central question isn’t whether to adopt this technology, but how swiftly organisations can integrate it to
stay ahead of the competition. This executive playbook explores how organisations can leverage this
technology to boost operational efficiency, enhance customer experience, and drive revenue growth. It provides
real-world success stories spanning industry sectors and organisational functions, strategic insights, tactical
blueprints, and best practices to guide your journey into this revolutionary landscape.

What is agentic AI?
Agentic AI generally refers to AI systems that
possess the capacity to make autonomous
decisions and take actions to achieve specific
goals with limited or no direct human
intervention3
.
Key aspects of agentic AI
Autonomy: Agentic AI systems
can operate independently,
making decisions based on their
programming, learning, and
environmental inputs.
Goal-oriented behaviour: These
AI agents are designed to pursue
specific objectives, optimising
their actions to achieve the
desired outcomes.
Environment interaction: An
agentic AI interacts with its
surroundings, perceiving changes
and adapting its strategies
accordingly.
Learning capability: Many
agentic AI systems employ
machine learning or
reinforcement learning techniques
to improve their performance over
time.
Workflow optimisation: Agentic
AI agents enhance workflows and
business processes by integrating
language understanding with
reasoning, planning, and
decision-making. This involves
optimising resource allocation,
improving communication and
collaboration, and identifying
automation opportunities.
Multi-agent and system
conversation: Agentic AI
facilitates communication
between different agents to
construct complex workflows. It
can also integrate with other
systems or tools, such as email,
code executors, or search
engines, to perform a variety of
tasks.

Evolution to multimodal GenAI agents
In AI, the only constant is change—embrace a culture of perpetual innovation.
The journey of agentic frameworks began as simple, rule-based systems designed to perform specific tasks. Over time,
these systems have evolved into sophisticated, multimodal agents capable of processing and integrating information from
various sources, such as text, images, and audio. Multimodality capabilities allow AI agents to understand, employ
reasoning, and interact like humans, enhancing their effectiveness and versatility to solve a wide range of business
problems4

 The evolution can be broken down into three key phases:
1. Integration of Machine Learning (ML)
○ Learning from data: The integration of ML allowed agents to learn from large datasets, improving their ability
to make decisions and perform tasks. This was a significant step forward from rule-based systems, as agents
could now adapt to new information and improve over time.
○ Natural Language Processing (NLP) enabled user interactions: Advances in NLP enabled agents to
understand and generate human language more effectively, making interactions more natural and intuitive.
2. Introduction of multimodality
○ Combining text, images, and audio: Multimodal agents emerged, capable of processing and integrating
information from various sources. For instance, an agent could analyse a text description, recognise objects in
an image, and understand spoken commands. This multimodality made agents more versatile and capable of
handling complex tasks.
○ Enhanced user interactions: Multimodal agents could interact with users in more dynamic ways, such as
providing visual aids in response to text queries or understanding context from a combination of spoken and
visual inputs.
3. Advanced autonomy and real-time interactions
○ Advanced autonomy: Agents can operate independently, rationalise and set their own goals, develop path(s)
to attain these goals, and make independent decisions without constant human intervention, leveraging data
from multiple sources or synthetic datasets. In a multi-agentic orchestration system, the first set of agents
focus on mimicking human behaviour (e.g. ChatGPT-4o), that is, thinking fast to come up with solution
approach, while the second set of agents focus on slow reasoning (e.g. ChatGPT-1o) to come up with a vetted
solution5
. Combining thinking fast and slow reasoning, agents can process information and make optimal
decisions in real-time – crucial for applications like autonomous vehicles, real-time customer service, and
various mission-critical business processes. This autonomy makes agentic AI particularly powerful in dynamic
and complex real-world environments.
○ User interactions within an ethical and responsible AI-controlled environment: With increased
capabilities, there has also been a focus on ensuring that agentic systems operate ethically and responsibly,
considering factors such as bias, transparency, and accountability.

Why organisations should pay attention
In the fast lane of technological evolution, missing the AI turn today means being outpaced tomorrow.
Agentic AI offers significant advantages in efficiency, decision-making, and customer interaction. By automating routine
tasks and providing intelligent insights, agentic AI can help organisations save time, reduce cost, and improve overall
productivity. Moreover, organisations who adopt an agentic AI system can gain a competitive advantage by leveraging its
capabilities to innovate and enhance their business operations. Lower cost to entry and economies of scale makes it
favourable for organisations to fully harness the capabilities it offers compared to its predecessors like traditional ML and
Robotic Process Automation (RPA)-driven automations.
Agentic AI systems can significantly enhance an organisation’s competitive edge by automating complex workflows,
reducing operational costs, and improving decision-making processes. These systems are designed to adapt to changing
business environments, driving higher productivity and enabling organisations to stay competitive. For example, agentic AI
can predict market trends and customer preferences, allowing businesses to tailor their strategies proactively. This
adaptability not only improves efficiency but also fosters innovation, giving companies a significant edge over competitors6
.
Moreover, agentic AI systems can handle large volumes of data and extract actionable insights, which can be used to
optimise operations and enhance customer experiences. By automating routine tasks, these systems free up human
resources to focus on more strategic initiatives, thereby increasing overall organisational agility and responsiveness7
.
Agentic AI systems can analyse vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, providing valuable insights to inform better
decision-making. Businesses can leverage these insights to optimise revenue and operations, identify market trends, and
make data-driven decisions. For instance, in the financial sector, AI can analyse market data to predict trends, inform
investment strategies, and boost investment ROI. In retail, it can streamline inventory management by predicting demand
and optimising stock levels.
Agentic AI can significantly enhance business efficiency and productivity by automating routine tasks and processes. This
allows employees to focus on more strategic and creative activities. For example, in customer service, agentic AI can
handle common inquiries, freeing up human agents to tackle more complex issues. In manufacturing, AI-driven robots can
manage repetitive tasks with precision and consistency, reducing errors and increasing output.
By integrating agentic AI, businesses can offer personalised and responsive customer experiences. AI-driven chatbots and
virtual assistants can provide instant support, answer queries, and even recommend products based on customer
preferences and dynamic interactions. This improves customer satisfaction, builds loyalty, and drives sales. For example,
e-commerce platforms use AI to recommend products based on browsing history and purchase behaviour.
Enhanced decision-making
Boosted efficiency and productivity
Improved customer experience
Agentic AI systems are redefining customer service centres and are gaining popularity as a game-changing capability
for both government entities and private sector organisations. While traditional rule-based chatbots
(software-as-a-service) provided basic 24/7 support, and Retrieval Augmented Generated (RAG)-based chatbots
enhanced human-like interactions (enhanced software-as-a-service), agentic AI surpasses both in terms of accuracy,
contextual coherence, and problem-solving ability.
In terms of accuracy, rule-based chatbots are limited to programmed responses, causing inaccuracies when queries
fall outside of predefined rules. RAG-based chatbots depend on retrieved data that may not match user intent. In
contrast, the novel approach of agentic AI allows it to understand nuances in language, generating accurate responses
even to complex or unseen queries. Its ability to learn from vast datasets enhances precision and adaptability, making
it superior for customer interactions.
One of the biggest limitations of chatbots has been contextual coherence. Rule-based chatbots struggle to maintain
context in extended interactions due to linear scripting, leading to disjointed responses that harm customer
experience. RAG-based chatbots may produce inconsistent replies if retrieval mechanisms don't consider previous
interactions. Whereas agentic AI’s orchestration capability helps it excel at tracking conversation history,
understanding dialogue flow, ensuring responses remain contextually appropriate and coherent, significantly boosting
customer engagement.
Thus far, both rule-based and RAG-based chatbots have limited autonomous problem-solving ability. The former can't
handle problems outside their scripts while the latter provide information but can't synthesise data and prepare the
human-live problem-solving logic to solve complex issues across integrated sources such as CRMs, ERP, or IVR
systems. The agentic AI performs dynamic reasoning and decision-making, leveraging a series of autonomous agents,
analysing customer issues, considering multiple factors, and applying learned knowledge to resolve problems more
efficiently. The outcome is quicker, solution-oriented, and fluid conversations that enhance customer experience and
set new standards for efficiency and responsiveness in automated customer service. Micro-agents

How to conceptualise agentic AI
solutions for future business operations
Agentic AI business imperatives
Organisations managing day-to-day operations stand to gain significantly from agentic AI systems, embracing the
emerging "service-as-a-software" model. This innovative approach transforms manual labour into automated, AI-driven
services. Rather than purchasing traditional software licences or subscribing to cloud-based software-as-a-service
(SaaS), businesses can now pay for specific outcomes delivered by AI agents. For example, a company might employ
AI customer support agents like Sierra to resolve issues on their websites, paying per resolution rather than maintaining
a costly human support team. This model allows organisations to access a wider range of services – whether it’s legal
support from AI-powered lawyers, continuous cybersecurity testing by AI penetration testers, or automated CRM
management – at a fraction of the cost. This not only drives efficiency but also significantly reduces operational
overheads.
By leveraging the service-as-a-software model, businesses can automate both routine and highly specialised tasks that
were once time-consuming, required skilled professionals, and typically involved expensive software licences or cloud
solutions. AI applications with advanced reasoning capabilities can now handle complex tasks, from software
engineering to running customer care centres, enabling companies to scale their operations without a proportional
increase in cost. This transition expands the services available to organisations of all sizes, freeing them to focus on
strategic priorities while AI systems manage the operational burden. Adopting these AI-driven services positions
businesses to stay competitive in an ever-evolving marketplace8
.
Service-as-a-software represents an outcome-focused, strategic shift, enabling organisations to transition from their
current state to operating in "copilot" and ultimately "autopilot" modes. Sierra, for instance, offers a safety net by
escalating complex customer issues to human agents when necessary, ensuring a seamless customer experience.
While not all AI solutions offer this built-in fallback, a common strategy is to initially deploy AI in a "copilot" role
alongside human workers. This human-in-the-loop approach helps organisations build trust in AI capabilities over time.
As AI systems demonstrate their reliability, businesses can confidently transition to an "autopilot" mode, where AI
operates autonomously, enhancing efficiency and reducing the need for human oversight. GitHub Copilot is a prime
example of this, assisting developers and potentially automating more tasks as it evolves.
For organisations with high operational costs, outsourcing specific tasks to AI services that guarantee concrete
outcomes is an increasingly attractive option. Take Sierra, for example: businesses integrate Sierra into their customer
support systems to efficiently manage customer queries. Instead of paying for software licences or cloud-based
services, they pay Sierra based on the number of successful resolutions. This outcome-based model aligns costs
directly with the results delivered, allowing organisations to harness AI for specific tasks and pay solely for the
outcomes achieved.
This shift from traditional software licences or cloud SaaS to service-as-a-software is transformative in several ways:
Targeting service profits: Traditional SaaS focused on selling user seats, whereas service-as-a-software taps into
service profit pools, delivering solutions that focus on specific business outcomes.
Outcome-based pricing: Instead of charging per user or seat, service-as-a-software adopts a pricing model based on
the actual outcomes achieved, directly aligning costs with results.
High-touch delivery models: Service-as-a-software offers a top-down, highly personalised approach, providing
trusted, tailored solutions that meet the specific operational needs of businesses.

opportunity window with agentic AI solutions and adopt a strategic approach, recalibrating AI strategies to fully
harness agentic AI solutions across a broader spectrum of business use cases and processes. Only a handful—like
Amazon, Google, Meta etc.—will embrace an AI-first mindset, reimagining products, services, and processes to
redefine value creation mechanisms. In this transformation, agentic AI systems will take the lead role with humans as
co-pilots, optimising speed, accuracy, contextual coherence, and cost-efficiency. Human oversight will evolve,
shifting focus toward more strategic planning and innovations rather than operational management.
The shift from human-driven, labour-intensive processes to AI-managed operations will see autonomous agents
handling tasks with unprecedented speed, precision, and adaptability. This transformation will not only reduce costs
but also unlock new revenue streams and growth opportunities, allowing businesses and governments to deliver
services faster and at a much larger scale.
As agentic AI systems become more integrated, they will redefine how we work, pushing the boundaries of possibility
and enabling a smarter, more agile world. The future of agentic AI is nearer than anticipated, propelled by rapid
technological advancements. However, realising its full potential requires greater commitment and adoption across
both government and industry.
Leaders at the forefront of AI adoption aren't just leveraging technology—they're redefining what's possible. Success
in this arena won't be accidental; it demands strategic vision, meticulous planning, and relentless execution. For
C-suite executives and senior leaders, embracing agentic AI is not just an option but a strategic imperative to stay
ahead in an increasingly competitive and AI-driven world.
The future belongs to those who prepare for it today—make AI the
cornerstone of your strategic arsenal.
